## Core

| Method | Path | Summary |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/` | API root |
| GET | `/health` | Health check endpoint |

## Products

| Method | Path | Summary |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/products` | List all products in the catalog |
| POST | `/products/avails` | OpenDirect availability check for a product (shared `iab_agentic_primitives.protocol` avails contract). Availability is derived from the catalog (`requestedImpressions`, else budget-derived at the product CPM, else `minimum_impressions`; capped by `maximum_impressions` when set); unpriceable products are a 422, `deliveryConfidence` is omitted (no forecast data source), and `guaranteedImpressions` appears only for PG-capable products — nothing is fabricated, nothing is null-padded |
| GET | `/products/{product_id}` | Get a specific product |

## Pricing

## Proposals

| Method | Path | Summary |
|--------|------|---------|
| POST | `/proposals` | Submit a proposal for review |

`pricing_verified` on the response is quote-anchored: it requires a quote

quote returns `pricing_verified: false` by design. See
