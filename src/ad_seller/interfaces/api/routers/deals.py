"""Deal endpoints: legacy generation, IAB Deals API v1.0 booking, agentic
audience match, template/bulk/curated creation, DSP export/push, SSP
distribution, and migration/deprecation/lineage.

EP-8.4 route-shadowing fix: literal/static routes are registered BEFORE
their ``{param}`` sibling on the same method + prefix, because FastAPI
matches routes in registration order. In particular
``GET /api/v1/deals/export`` is now registered BEFORE
``GET /api/v1/deals/{deal_id}`` so the literal export path is reachable
(previously ``{deal_id}="export"`` shadowed it). Path strings, methods,
and handler behavior are otherwise unchanged.

    """Book a deal from a previously issued quote.

    The seller validates the quote, generates a Deal ID, and returns
    confirmed terms. This is the commit point — the quote becomes bound.

    **Wire format (proposal §5.6 + §6 row 14b):** the seller accepts both
    audience-plan content types --
    ``application/vnd.ucp.embedding+json; v=1`` (legacy UCP carrier) and
    ``application/vnd.iab.agentic-audiences+json; v=1`` (new IAB Agentic
    Audiences alias). FastAPI's body parsing is content-type-permissive, so
    both names round-trip the same Pydantic model with no custom dependency
    needed; the dual acceptance is exercised by
    ``tests/unit/test_deal_booking_snapshot.py``.

    **Snapshot (proposal §5.1 Step 2 + wire-format §6.5):** when the request
    carries an ``audience_plan``, the seller persists it verbatim as
    ``audience_plan_snapshot`` against the deal record and returns the
    snapshot plus a per-role ``audience_match_summary`` so the buyer can
    verify the booking. The snapshot is authoritative for the lifetime of
    the deal -- if seller capabilities change mid-flight, the snapshot is
    honored (see ``services/fulfillment.honor_audience_plan_snapshot``).

    **Forensic logging (proposal §5.1 Step 2):** the
    ``audience_plan_id`` hash is logged at INFO via
    ``ad_seller.audience.booking``. The buyer logs the same hash on its
    side; matching entries are the cross-system anchor for dispute
    resolution.

    **Authentication (security fix):** every other money-moving path
    (quotes, proposals, negotiation, template booking) requires a verified
    buyer via ``deps._verified_buyer_context``; this route was deliberately
    skipped when that wave landed (July 2026, EP-5.2) because it books at
    the already-capped quoted price -- price integrity was covered, but the
    caller's identity was not. An OPTIONAL key was used only to scope the
    idempotency namespace, so anyone who learned a ``quote_id`` could book
    it at another buyer's negotiated tier pricing. A verified buyer is now
    REQUIRED (401 if absent), and the caller must be the buyer the
    referenced quote was priced for -- both by recorded identity (when the
    quote's origin is on record via ``QuoteHistoryStore``) and by tier
    (403 ``buyer_mismatch`` / ``buyer_tier_mismatch`` otherwise). A quote
    priced at the PUBLIC tier (no identity asserted at quote time) has
    nothing buyer-specific to steal, so any authenticated buyer may book it.

    **Idempotency (FD-12):** the request carries a required
    ``idempotency_key``. A replay with a key already used for an identical
    body returns the same Deal without minting a second one (no duplicate
    side effect); the same key reused with a different body is an
    ``idempotency_conflict`` (HTTP 409). The key is scoped per buyer
    (FD-12) — the now-required API key identity takes priority, matching
    the priority order used to resolve buyer identity elsewhere.
